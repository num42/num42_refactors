## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `ExtractBehaviourFromAdapterFamily`: detects module families with a
  shared public API via BEAM introspection (`__info__(:functions)` +
  implemented behaviours), scores candidate pairs (sibling/same-depth
  namespace bonus), synthesizes a behaviour module with spec-derived
  callbacks, and inserts `@behaviour`/`@impl true` into the members.
  The surface counts genuine `def`s only — `defdelegate`s (unrewritten
  call sites) and `use`-injected functions (`child_spec/1`, `start_link`
  from `GenServer`/`Supervisor`/`Ecto.Repo`, …) are intersected out.
  Optional `:require_dispatch` keeps only families with a polymorphic
  call site (`var.fun(..)`/`apply(var, :fun, ..)`, framework receivers
  like `repo`/`conn` ignored); when on, families seed from the smallest
  dispatched core and majority-shared functions become
  `@optional_callbacks`. **Default off** (opt in via `.refactor.exs`):
  shape-based matching tends to surface coincidences over genuine
  abstractions. See num42/num42_refactors#158 for the protocol sibling.
- `MemberToInOperator`: `Enum.member?(coll, x)` → `x in coll`, negated
  calls fold to `not in`; guard context gated on literal collections.
- `MapSumToSumBy`: `Enum.map(coll, fun) |> Enum.sum()` →
  `Enum.sum_by(coll, fun)` (Elixir 1.18+).
- `EnumFindToKeyfind`: `Enum.find(list, fn {k, _} -> k == key end)` →
  `List.keyfind(list, key, 0)`, incl. the `elem(t, n) ==` form.
- `MergePipelineIntoComprehension` now also fuses
  `Enum.reject |> Enum.map` (`for x <- coll, !pred(x), do: f(x)`).
- Initial public release, extracted from an internal project.
- ~60 AST refactors covering Enum/Map/Stream idioms, pattern-matching
  rewrites, pipe and `with` reshaping, definition hygiene, cross-file
  extraction, and HEEx clone consolidation.
- `mix refactor` task with `--check` (CI), `--log` (per-refactor
  rationale + diff), `--auto` (commit per refactor), `--step-by-step`,
  and `--dry-run` modes.
- `Number42.Refactors.Refactor` behaviour for authoring custom refactors.
- `.refactor.exs` project-level configuration.
